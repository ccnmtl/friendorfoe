On Sunday, November 28, 2010, Alan Rusbridger—editor of the left-leaning
British *Guardian* newspaper—and a team of journalists pledged to months
of secrecy were finally scheduled to go public with one of the most
explosive collections of documents in the paper’s history: 250,000
classified US diplomatic cables recording confidential conversations and
contacts around the world. In this project, the *Guardian* had four
media partners: the *New York Times* (US), *Der* *Spiegel (*Germany*)*,
*Le Monde* (France), and *El País* (Spain).

The five publications had come into possession of the cables thanks to a
21^st^-century organization called WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks was founded in
2007 by Julian Assange, a brilliant and mercurial Australian former
computer hacker. Assange believed that information, even classified or
dangerous information, should be available to everyone. It was in that
spirit that he had already given the *Guardian, New York Times*,
and *Spiegel* official US frontline records from the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq. In an agreement forged originally by Assange and the
*Guardian*, the three had simultaneously published the so-called War
Logs in July and October 2010.

While there had been moments of tension, the War Logs publication had
gone fairly smoothly. The same could not be said of the diplomatic
cables. Logistics had been a nightmare. First, there was
redaction—editing the cables so no one would suffer death or
retaliation. That had taken weeks of intensive labor by a small group of
journalists; organizing and tracking the process required a
purpose-built database. Then there was the challenge of arranging for
simultaneous publication across time zones and languages by five news
partners with widely varying deadlines. A massive grid tried to
reconcile the multiple conflicts.


	What&rsquo;s more, relations with Assange&mdash;never 
simple&mdash;had become fraught. The two principal <em>Guardian</em> 
reporters on the War Logs stories no longer spoke to him. Assange had 
also conceived an abiding hatred for the <em>New York Times</em>, and 
the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Spiegel</em> had fought fiercely to keep 
the <em>Times</em> in the consortium. To appease Assange somewhat, they 
acceded to his 11<sup>th</sup>-hour demand to include <em>Le Monde</em> 
and <em>El Pa&iacute;s</em> in the release of the diplomatic cables.

	There were also legal worries. The cables were classified and revealed, 
for example, the damaging news that Saudi Arabia had encouraged the US to 
bomb Iran; that Pakistan&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal could be threatened; that 
the US State Department had asked its diplomats to spy on United Nations 
personnel; or that the government of Yemen had offered to cover for US 
raids on Muslim radicals in Yemen. Britain had an Official Secrets Act 
that was frequently invoked to prevent publication of sensitive materials. 
The US had an Espionage Act. Either government might yet intervene.

	Editor Rusbridger was confident the <em>Guardian</em> and its partners 
had acted conscientiously in preparing to release the cables. Nonetheless, he 
couldn&rsquo;t repress a persistent worry&mdash;what if publishing them at 
all was in some fundamental way a mistake? Perhaps the paper was too caught 
up in the drama and momentum of the project to comprehend its full impact. 
What if people died as a result? Or the cables incited mass violence?

	On November 26, as the paper completed final steps toward launch, 
Rusbridger&rsquo;s doubts were reawakened by a thoughtful email from a 
trusted and respected colleague outside the small WikiLeaks team. Would 
publication damage the administration of US President Barack Obama, he asked, 
and derail much of what the <em>Guardian</em> itself stood for? Might 
Democrat Obama fail to win approval for a new arms control treaty from 
the Republican Congress? &ldquo;Are we serving our interests, by 
publishing material which weakens a president, who we think is 
trying to do the right thing?&rdquo; wrote the colleague.

	<p>
		I just wonder whether we are not putting ourselves in the 
		position, whether we are serving the opposition, and undermining our 
		own stand, on so many of the issues that we care about.
	</p>
</blockquote>

	Rusbridger was not a man easily flustered. But for all the care 
the <em>Guardian</em> had exercised, he could see that this project 
had the potential to go seriously wrong.
