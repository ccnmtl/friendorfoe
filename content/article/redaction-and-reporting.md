	The <em>Guardian</em> told <em>Le Monde</em> and <em>El Pa&iacute;s </em>about the new 
	arrangement shortly after the November 1 meeting. The new papers had barely three weeks 
	to sift through the massive trove of cables before the agreed-on digital publication date 
	of November 28. The pre-existing partners listed the stories they had already uncovered. 
	For example, <em>Spiegel</em> had been the first to notice cables about the State Department 
	ordering US diplomats to spy on UN officials. The <em>New York Times</em> had closely examined 
	materials on Saudi Arabia encouraging the US to bomb Iranian nuclear installations. 
	The <em>Guardian</em> targeted cables about the relationship between China and North Korea. 
	Meanwhile, both new consortium members, especially the Spanish publication, helped uncover 
	some new stories, including one about US diplomats seeking to influence judges.

<p>
	On November 11, all the parties gathered to fine-tune the publication grid. Assange 
	came with a lawyer, while <em>New York Times</em> Deputy Foreign Editor Ian Fisher 
	flew in from the US. <em>Guardian</em> Deputy Editor Katz took on the coordination 
	job. He prepared a grid tracking which papers would publish which stories on which 
	days. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want to scoop each other,&rdquo; says Leigh. It was complex. 
	For example, for all to publish simultaneously on a Sunday, the weekly <em>Spiegel</em> would 
	have to suspend its standard electronic distribution Saturday&mdash;a costly adjustment. 
	&ldquo;There was a heart sink about how on earth we would synchronize across four languages 
	[and] three different production schedules,&rdquo; says Katz, referring to <em>Le Monde</em>, 
	an afternoon paper, and <em>El</em> <em>Pa&iacute;s</em>, which published at midnight.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>Redactions</em>.</strong> Preparing the diplomatic cables 
	and related stories for publication was tough. Not only did reporters have to 
	extract the best stories from the documents, but the cables themselves had to 
	be redacted to remove any references which might threaten the lives of those 
	named. Each individual reporter had first responsibility for redacting the 
	cables that supported his articles. Key correspondents, such as Luke Harding 
	in Moscow, were summoned back to London to join the team. Other star reporters 
	based in Washington, Brussels, Africa, India, and Latin America joined the team 
	remotely. Walsh, who had returned for the war logs and stayed to work on a book, 
	took on the Pakistan- and Afghanistan-related cables. In the run-up to November 28, 
	says Katz, the <em>Guardian</em> had upwards of 25 reporters and editors involved.

<p>
	The second layer of redaction was Production Manager 
	<a href="biographies/jon-casson/">Jon Casson</a>, who tried to spot 
	anything missed the first time around. Casson set up shop in another 
	4<sup>th</sup> floor room typically used for training. He read every 
	story and its associated cables. Even if a reporter referred only to 
	a couple of paragraphs in a lengthy cable, Casson had to read the whole 
	thing because the papers had undertaken to post entire cables. He kept 
	track of where in the process each story stood. Most stories pulled 
	together several cables, so those were all redacted to be released 
	simultaneously with the story. Casson not only went through <em>Guardian</em> 
	redactions carefully, but compared the <em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s version 
	to those of the other media partners.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>Partners</em>.</strong> These problems were multiplied times five 
	by the media partnership. All five news outlets had agreed to maintain the 
	same secrecy observed for the Afghan and Iraq war logs. No one would mention 
	a cable in either an email or a phone conversation. Instead, they held paper 
	copies of cables up to a camera in a Skype exchange, so that all could see 
	the subject of the conversation. Spy-movie attempts to use disposable phones 
	and other security devices, however, were amusing, but flopped. &ldquo;We 
	were essentially completely useless at any of the spooky stuff,&rdquo; said Katz.
	<a href="case_id_70_id_633.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> 
	&ldquo;The whole coordination was very difficult,&rdquo; says Casson. &ldquo;
	We did the best we could.&rdquo;
	<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> He adds:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		It was just the volume, and the urge to publish as much as possible in as 
		short a time as possible, was quite difficult. If it was just the 
		<em>Guardian</em> publishing, I think it would have been much more 
		of a straightforward process.
	</p>
</blockquote>

	<img alt="" border="0" class="audiofile" src="../../files/audios/190/Casson&#32;text&#32;quote.mp3" />
</p>

<p>
	Casson designed a massive online spreadsheet that tracked each cable by number, the 
	ID number for its related stories, whether the cable had been redacted, whether the 
	redaction had been coordinated with partner publications, and when the story and cable 
	were slated for publication. In the beginning, Casson and two helpers were processing 
	upwards of 200 cables a day. In the end, he tracked more than 900 cables, each color 
	coded for their stage of redaction. Despite their best efforts, sometimes the partners 
	published different versions of a cable. In a very few instances, the publications agreed 
	not to use a cable at all because it was too sensitive. Topics that qualified for exclusion 
	were strategic secrets, information on nuclear power plants or oil pipelines, or details 
	on military operations.
</p>

<p>
	Casson worked hard to avoid defamation or endangering individuals. He consulted with 
	<em>Guardian</em> lawyers on a daily basis. Diplomats or public figures were fair game. 
	&ldquo;But what really kept me awake most night was, if we&rsquo;re publishing a 
	source&rsquo;s name, is that going to put that person, or that person&rsquo;s family, 
	in danger?&rdquo; recalls Casson. Sometimes deleting a name was not enough; place 
	names and dates also had to come out. Likewise, he deleted pronouns in instances 
	when a female speaker would be identifiable. That meant deleting not only &ldquo;she&rdquo; 
	and &ldquo;her,&rdquo; but &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; from time to time so it 
	would not be obvious when a woman was meant.
</p>

<p>
	At the <em>Guardian</em>, secrecy was as tight or tighter than it had been for 
	the war logs. The team continued to work out of two small, fourth-floor rooms. 
	&ldquo;I think I told the foreign editor, because I had to bring some of his people 
	back. But we kept it very, very tight,&rdquo; recalls Katz. &ldquo;We only told the 
	main news editors a week before publication.&rdquo; All the reporters working on the 
	project were forbidden to discuss their work.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>Dangerous</em>. </strong>There were also disputes over which cables 
	to use. Leigh had made the first cut at discerning which cables would produce 
	worthwhile stories. The second round of selections looked at geography. If with 
	the war logs the <em>Guardian</em> had worried about injunctions, now it also had 
	to worry about upsetting the world order. Recalls Deputy Editor Katz: &ldquo;More 
	than one of our spouses, and certainly mine, said at the time, &lsquo;What on earth 
	are you doing, and why on earth are you doing this? You&rsquo;re going to start a 
	war somewhere.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
	One group of cables, for example, revealed that the Yemeni government had said 
	it would claim US air attacks on militants as its own. The <em>New York Times</em> 
	(with <em>Spiegel</em>&rsquo;s concurrence) was reluctant to publicize some of the 
	Yemen material for fear of repercussions on a strategic relationship, but the 
	<em>Guardian</em> and <em>El Pa&iacute;s </em>saw no real danger in reporting it 
	(<em>Le Monde</em> couldn&rsquo;t decide). &ldquo;The debate was around, you will 
	have blood on your hands if you publish this, because this is the front line of 
	the fight against Islamist baddies,&rdquo; says Rusbridger.
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		And you will really undermine that fight by publishing this. The counterargument 
		was, but we&rsquo;re been down this route before [in Iraq 2003 and alleged 
		weapons of mass destruction] of suppressing stuff in order to depend on people 
		who appear to be on our side.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Other sensitive material concerned US views of Russian leaders, suspicions about 
	the close relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime 
	Minister Silvio Berlusconi, the business dealings of some Russian oligarchs, and 
	top-level corruption in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. While the UK Official Secrets 
	Act technically covered some of this, the press did have on its side the so-called 
	1999 Reynolds Defense, a legal precedent which allowed the media to publish unproven 
	allegations if they were acting responsibly and in the public interest, and followed 
	standard journalistic procedures.
</p>

<p>
	The partners eventually came to agreement on which stories to run. The big ones 
	would be rolled out simultaneously; the timing for others of chiefly regional 
	interest were left up to the individual publication. &ldquo;We had furious arguments 
	along the way, but it was an incredibly complicated thing to do,&rdquo; notes Rusbridger.
