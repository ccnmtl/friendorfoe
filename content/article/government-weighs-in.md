	The <em>Guardian</em> was not inclined to ask for comments in advance of publication. 
	Such an action would have opened it up to injunctions under the Official Secrets Act on 
	the grounds that the newspaper was in unlawful possession of confidential documents. 
	&ldquo;Our instincts, coming from a European tradition, would have been not to,&rdquo; 
	comments Rusbridger. But the <em>New York Times</em> took a different view and, on 
	November 19, first approached the White House to let it know which cables it planned 
	to disclose. &ldquo;When Bill [Keller] said we&rsquo;re going to go a week in advance, 
	we were all quite uneasy,&rdquo; recalls Rusbridger, partly from fear of injunction.
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		I think all the European partners were anxious. And I think, left to our own devices, we 
		wouldn&rsquo;t have done what Bill [Keller] did&hellip; It was a difficult position where 
		you felt obliged to get some reaction. But the longer you gave them, the longer it gave 
		them to injunct us.
	</p>

	Also, says Katz, the <em>Guardian</em> was well aware that &ldquo;often, institutions and 
	governments dress up in security terms things which are simply embarrassing or are politically 
	inconvenient.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
	The <em>Times</em> forwarded White House comments to the <em>Guardian</em>&mdash;an 
	awkward arrangement because it was not clear whether the <em>Times</em> represented the 
	other media partners and whether it was a formal clearance process or an informal one.
	<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> 
	So on Friday, November 26, the White House hosted a conference call with Rusbridger, 
	Deputy Editor Katz, US Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley, and representatives 
	from Defense, intelligence community, and the National Security Council. Crowley 
	stated that &ldquo;from our perspective, these are stolen documents,&rdquo; to which 
	the British editors did not reply.
</p>

<p>
	Crowley asked Rusbridger for the numbers of the cables the paper intended to use, but Rusbridger 
	would not oblige. He did disclose the <em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s intended publication schedule: Day 1, 
	Iran; Day 2, North Korea; Day 3, Pakistan. Quite soon Crowley, worried that the government was 
	giving out more information than it was getting, wrapped up the call. Apparently, as Investigations 
	Editor Leigh recalls, &ldquo;they weren&rsquo;t going to come after us. They were going to engage 
	with us instead.&rdquo; Just before publication, says Rusbridger, the <em>Guardian</em> also heard 
	from the British government&mdash;&ldquo;a sort of private message from Number 10 [Downing Street] 
	saying don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re not going to injunct you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
	By the target publication date of November 28, the <em>Guardian</em> had more than 160 articles ready 
	to go and more in production. On the eve of publication, however, Editor Rusbridger found himself 
	questioning whether the newspaper had made the right choice.

			<em>Der Spiegel</em> came in for its fair share of pressure as well; the US ambassador 
			called Editor Mascolo to warn against publishing the cables. The government also asked 
			WikiLeaks not to publish and hand back all records. Assange in fact offered to consider 
			US objections and said WikiLeaks had no desire to put anyone at risk.
