	The <em>Guardian</em> was not inclined to ask for comments in 
advance of publication. Such an action would have opened it up to 
injunctions under the Official Secrets Act on the grounds that the 
newspaper was in unlawful possession of confidential documents. 
&ldquo;Our instincts, coming from a European tradition, would have 
been not to,&rdquo; comments Rusbridger. But the <em>New York Times</em> 
took a different view and, on November 19, first approached the 
White House to let it know which cables it planned to disclose. 
&ldquo;When Bill [Keller] said we&rsquo;re going to go a week in 
advance, we were all quite uneasy,&rdquo; recalls Rusbridger, 
partly from fear of injunction.
	
<blockquote>
	<p>
		I think all the European partners were anxious. And I think, 
		left to our own devices, we wouldn&rsquo;t have done what 
		Bill [Keller] did&hellip; It was a difficult position where 
		you felt obliged to get some reaction. But the longer you 
		gave them, the longer it gave them to injunct us.
	</p>
</blockquote>

	Also, says Katz, the <em>Guardian</em> was well aware that &ldquo;often, 
institutions and governments dress up in security terms things which are simply 
embarrassing or are politically inconvenient.&rdquo;

	The <em>Times</em> forwarded White House comments to the <em>Guardian</em>&mdash;an 
awkward arrangement because it was not clear whether the <em>Times</em> represented 
the other media partners and whether it was a formal clearance process or an informal 
one.<a href="case_id_70_id_634_pid_0.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> So 
on Friday, November 26, the White House hosted a conference call with Rusbridger, 
Deputy Editor Katz, US Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley, and 
representatives from Defense, intelligence community, and the National 
Security Council. Crowley stated that &ldquo;from our perspective, these 
are stolen documents,&rdquo; to which the British editors did not reply.

	Crowley asked Rusbridger for the numbers of the cables the paper intended 
to use, but Rusbridger would not oblige. He did disclose the <em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s 
intended publication schedule: Day 1, Iran; Day 2, North Korea; Day 3, Pakistan. Quite 
soon Crowley, worried that the government was giving out more information than it was 
getting, wrapped up the call. Apparently, as Investigations Editor Leigh recalls, 
&ldquo;they weren&rsquo;t going to come after us. They were going to engage with us 
instead.&rdquo; Just before publication, says Rusbridger, the <em>Guardian</em> also 
heard from the British government&mdash;&ldquo;a sort of private message from Number 
10 [Downing Street] saying don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re not going to injunct you.&rdquo;

	By the target publication date of November 28, the <em>Guardian</em> had more 
than 160 articles ready to go and more in production. On the eve of publication, 
however, Editor Rusbridger found himself questioning whether the newspaper 
had made the right choice.

			<em>Der Spiegel</em> came in for its fair share of pressure as well; 
			the US ambassador called Editor Mascolo to warn against publishing the cables. 
			The government also asked WikiLeaks not to publish and hand back all records. 
			Assange in fact offered to consider US objections and said WikiLeaks had no 
			desire to put anyone at risk.
