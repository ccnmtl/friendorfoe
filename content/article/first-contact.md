<p>
	Davies occupied a special place at the <em>Guardian</em>. A staff reporter 
	for many years, he had been since 1987 a freelancer contracted to report 
	only for the <em>Guardian</em>. His job was to find the blockbuster stories 
	no one else had noticed and pursue them&mdash;as he puts it, &ldquo;seeing 
	what must be there that isn&rsquo;t included in what&rsquo;s being written.&rdquo;
	<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> 
	The strategy had paid off handsomely; Davies in 2009 alone broke two consequential 
	stories: that the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, <em>News of the World</em>, 
	had hacked into celebrity voicemail accounts, and that Murdoch&rsquo;s umbrella 
	company News Corporation had paid huge sums to settle legal cases related to the 
	phone hacking.
</p>

<p>
	When Davies saw the item on Manning&rsquo;s arrest and the hunt for Assange, 
	he thought &ldquo;maybe the real story isn&rsquo;t that four paragraphs, 
	it&rsquo;s the secrets. It was extraordinary that nobody else was trying 
	to get hold of Julian [Assange] to ask him what these secrets were and 
	whether they could have them.&rdquo; Davies thought it possible that Assange 
	could be persuaded to share his files&mdash;whatever they contained&mdash;with 
	the <em>Guardian</em>. On June 16, 2010, he tried to reach Assange via email. 
	Assange replied, but cryptically. Then Davies was tipped that Assange was 
	planning to appear in Brussels on Monday, June 21, at a press conference.
</p>

<p>
	Davies consulted with <em>Guardian</em> Investigations Editor 
	<a href="biographes/david-leigh/">David Leigh</a>, 
	who had already crossed paths with Assange. Leigh felt there was little merit to pursuing 
	the WikiLeaks founder. But Editor Rusbridger approved Davies to travel to Brussels. Another 
	<em>Guardian</em> reporter, European correspondent Ian Traynor, was already in the Belgian 
	capital and cornered Assange after the press conference; the Australian agreed to meet again 
	on Tuesday, June 22.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>Agreement</em>. </strong>On Tuesday afternoon, Davies and Traynor met Assange at 
	the Hotel Leopold in Brussels. Traynor had to leave, but Davies and Assange talked for some 
	six hours. Davies wanted above all to find out what Assange had, whether it was worth anything, 
	and whether he would share it with the <em>Guardian</em>. On the first two points, the news 
	seemed good: Assange claimed to have more than a million official US documents, divided into 
	four significant batches: battle reports from Iraq; battle reports from Afghanistan; US diplomatic 
	cables from around the world; and internal communications on operations at the US detention center 
	in Guantanamo Bay. Assange had wanted to post some of these on the WikiLeaks website for at least 
	two weeks, but had refrained out of concern for Private Manning.
</p>

<p>
	As for sharing, Davies and Traynor made the argument that Assange could reach far more 
	readers, and gain valuable credibility for his trove, if he aligned his efforts with the 
	<em>Guardian</em>. &ldquo;We are going to put you on the moral high ground&mdash;so high that 
	you&rsquo;ll need an oxygen mask,&rdquo; Davies told Assange.
	<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> 
	But Davies wanted to go even further. On the train to Brussels, he had decided to ask Assange 
	if he would endorse working with a consortium of publications.
</p>

<p>
	Davies wanted primarily to protect the <em>Guardian</em> against draconian UK libel 
	and secrecy laws. Britain had nothing like the free speech protection that US journalists 
	enjoyed under the First Amendment. Partnership with a US publication such as the 
	<em>New York Times</em>, he theorized, would give the <em>Guardian</em> indirect access 
	to that shield. For the <em>Guardian</em>, collaboration with other news outlets was 
	nothing new. In 2009, it had worked with the BBC, a Dutch paper, and a Norwegian TV 
	station to publish stories on the Trafigura company. In 2006, it worked with TV and print 
	organizations in Sweden, Romania, and Tanzania on a story about corruption at the British 
	arms firm BAE.
</p>

<p>
	To Davies&rsquo; delight, Assange agreed readily. &ldquo;I was pushing at an open door in putting 
	this argument to him,&rdquo; says Davies, &ldquo;because he was aware that the Wiki model was a 
	failure. He was already moving toward trying to use mainstream media to get more impact.&rdquo; 
	Davies and Assange were in accord that the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>New York Times</em> 
	would cull the database, extract a list of stories, publish some themselves and hand out the 
	remainder to other media outlets such as <em>Le Monde</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, Fox 
	television, or the German weekly magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>Terms</em>.</strong> By the end of the meeting, they had established terms 
	which would govern their lives for the next six months. Assange would provide the <em>Guardian</em> 
	with the four sets of data &ndash;war records from Afghanistan, the Iraq war logs, a trove of US 
	diplomatic cables, and personal files of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay&mdash;which it would distribute 
	to the partners; the partner news organizations would simultaneously publish each set of documents and 
	their related stories; and WikiLeaks would publish the documents at the same time on its own website. 
	Assange set only one condition: he would determine when publication started.
</p>

<p>
	Early the next morning, Wednesday, June 23, Davies headed back to London, where he 
	briefed Leigh and Rusbridger. Later that day, Rusbridger phoned Bill Keller, executive 
	editor of the <em>New York Times</em>. Did he want in on this deal? The answer was yes. 
	Meanwhile, Assange wanted <em>Spiegel</em> to become a full partner as well, and after 
	considerable back and forth, the magazine joined the team on June 29.
