The operation was, from the start, cloaked in secrecy. Assange was convinced 
that governments, especially the US, were tracking him and willing to use 
the most unscrupulous spycraft to gain access to his secrets. Assange turned 
over the first batch of records, reports from the war in Afghanistan&mdash;on 
Thursday, June 24, via a dedicated website to which he uploaded the files; Davies 
already had a password which Assange had scrawled on a napkin. After Davies downloaded 
them, the site disappeared. Assange insisted on complete security&mdash;passwords, 
encryption, no mention of the documents in phone calls or emails (which could be 
intercepted by government agencies). Communication would be conducted via Skype 
(which allows voice and video calls over the Internet) using accounts under 
fictitious names.

At the <em>Guardian</em>, Rusbridger set aside a fourth-floor room for the small 
team of reporters and tech staff detailed to go through the Afghan war logs 
(as they were dubbed). The <em>New York Times</em> dispatched war correspondent 
Eric Schmitt, and <em>Spiegel</em> sent reporters John Goetz and Marcel Rosenbach 
to see what it was WikiLeaks had provided. Each publication was given a copy. 
The three news organizations found a manageable way to apportion the work. 
Recalls Davies:


>When it came to choosing what stories to write and how to write them, we operated 
>independently. But there was a lot of collaboration to help each other get through 
>this mass of material.


For four and a half weeks, the <em>Guardian</em> group worked feverishly to turn the 
morass of encrypted field reports into intelligible news stories. The 
<em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s systems editor, Harold Frayman, devised a database 
to hold the 92,000-plus entries and make them searchable by keyword, name, date, or 
phrase. Correspondents such as Declan Walsh, stationed in Islamabad, were brought back 
without explanation to work on the logs. Resident experts such as Middle East Editor 
Ian Black were also on the team. Assange himself was back and forth to Stockholm, 
though throughout July he settled in London for days at a time, cycling among 
the homes of Davies, Leigh, and other friends.


The news organizations had three prevailing worries. One was logistical&mdash;how 
should they publish the Afghan reports, all at once or over several days? The second 
was ethical&mdash;how to redact the battlefield reports to protect individuals? 
The third was legal&mdash;would governments, especially the US and UK, try to 
stop publication altogether? After all, the US government must have learned from 
Private Manning what was in the documents.


<strong><em>Legal threat. </em></strong>The UK Official Secrets Act (amended in 1989) 
permitted prosecution of newspapers or journalists who published secret information, 
including that belonging to foreign governments. UK privacy law was also strict, 
and plaintiffs regularly succeeded in preventing publication of material they deemed 
libelous or confidential by obtaining court injunctions. &ldquo;We have to be 
much more paranoid than American journalists because the law is so 
prohibitive,&rdquo; says Davies. In order to reduce the risk of an injunction, 
the team decided to abandon the original idea of publishing a sequence of stories 
(some through other news organizations such as <em>Le Monde</em> or Fox television), 
and instead release all the Afghan stories in a single burst.



The US Espionage Act also had teeth and forbade unauthorized disclosure of 
classified material. The <em>Guardian</em> became particularly worried when 
the <em>New York Times</em>, as was its custom, on July 21 asked President 
Barack Obama&rsquo;s White House and the Pentagon for comment on the Afghan 
battle reports. Might the US government take preemptive action? As Rusbridger 
recalls, the <em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s external lawyers called him on the 
afternoon of Saturday, July 24, to caution: &ldquo;Are you thinking about 
this? Are you focusing on this enough? This could be really significant.&rdquo;
<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> 
They warned that it was not out of the question that Rusbridger could be 
extradited to the US or denied a visa. On the other hand, there was some 
protection in the fact that other papers&mdash;not to mention WikiLeaks&mdash; 
had the same information.


To the immense relief of all, publication went off smoothly. On Sunday, 
July 25, at 10 p.m. GMT, the three news organizations released their 
separate accounts of the Afghan war logs. Governments made no effort 
to prevent it. The Obama Administration, at least for now, seemed more 
intent on working with the media to limit damage than on lawsuits or injunctions.


The <em>Guardian</em> ran 14 pages of stories. It chose to focus on civilian deaths, 
particularly on a Special Operations group dubbed Task Force 373, which targeted the 
Taliban. The <em>New York Times</em> paid more attention to Pakistan&rsquo;s aid to 
the Taliban. The relevant cables&mdash;redacted&mdash;accompanied each article. Assange, 
by contrast, simultaneously published all but 15,000 &ldquo;threat reports&rdquo; 
(which he deemed the most sensitive) on the WikiLeaks website--unedited. Many criticized 
Assange as irresponsible. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
was forceful: &quot;Mr. Assange can say whatever he likes about the greater good he thinks 
he and his source are doing, but the truth is they might already have on their hands the 
blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family.&quot;
<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> 
A Taliban spokesman said his associates were studying the files to identify 
individuals: &ldquo;If they are US spies, then we know how to punish them.&rdquo;
<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>


While the documents were now safely in the public domain, the publication 
caused the first rupture between Assange and his media partners. The day 
before Sunday&rsquo;s publication, Davies learned that on Friday Assange 
had given the Afghan war logs and a summary of the stories the <em>Guardian</em> 
planned to run to Channel 4 (a British public-service national TV station), 
Al Jazeera, and CNN. Also on Saturday, Assange had taped an interview with Channel 4.



In Davies&rsquo; view, this blatantly broke the agreement Assange had concluded with the 
<em>Guardian</em> in June. It also made a mockery of the general attempts to 
preserve secrecy and threatened the exclusivity which Assange had promised the 
<em>Guardian</em> and its two partners. &nbsp;&ldquo;Julian understood that news 
organizations won&rsquo;t commit resources unless they&rsquo;re guaranteed that 
they&rsquo;re going to be the first to publish,&rdquo; says Davies. &ldquo;What 
then happened was that stage by stage, he proceeded to break the agreements.&rdquo; 
He adds:


>We had got to know Julian well, and we liked him and we trusted him. 
>Just at that personal level, it was pretty breathtaking that he had 
>done this&hellip; He thought that he had this power over us, that 
>he had so much lovely, juicy information that it didn&rsquo;t matter 
>how much he deceived, or how dishonest he was, or how many agreements 
>he broke.

Davies had another time-consuming assignment looming and decided to pull 
out of the WikiLeaks project to register his disapproval. He never spoke 
to Assange again. Davies wanted to send a message: &ldquo;No. We are not 
your servants. We are not here to be abused by sources of information. 
We&rsquo;re journalists. We will not be wagged by the tail of the dog.&rdquo; 
The episode changed Leigh&rsquo;s attitude as well. From now on, he would 
assume that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re dealing here with an untrustworthy person.&rdquo;



For his part, Assange was furious with the <em>New York Times</em> because, 
unlike the other two publications, it chose not to link directly to WikiLeaks 
in its online version of the Afghan war logs stories. Editor Keller explained 
he did this to preserve the <em>Times</em>&rsquo; credibility and independence. 
Assange was not persuaded.
