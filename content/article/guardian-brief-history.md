The paper Rusbridger headed was founded in 1821 as the *Manchester
Guardian*, based in northern England. The daily paper dropped
“Manchester” from the title in 1959, and in 1964 it moved operations to
London.<a href="case_id_70_id_626.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
 Its circulation in 2010 fell from over 300,000 to some
280,000—ranking about 10th among British national newspapers.
<a href="case_id_70_id_626.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Its
sister paper since 1993, the *Observer*, was published on Sundays. The
*Guardian* was the only national paper with an ombudsman (“readers’
editor”), first appointed in 1997. In late 2008, the company moved to a
modern building in the King’s Cross section of London.

A left-leaning publication from the start, the *Guardian* emerged with
time as a member of the “serious” national British daily press (along
with the *Financial Times*, the *Daily Telegraph*, the *Times* of
London, and the *Independent*). It was supported since 1936 by the Scott
Trust, established by John Russell Scott, whose family had owned and
edited the paper for decades. The Trust was pledged to preserve the
editorial independence of the paper. All profits went back into the
improvement of the publication, an unusual arrangement which to a degree
insulated the paper from economic fluctuations in the industry.


By the early 1990s, it had largely shed an early reputation for cheap
production and multiple typos (the satirical magazine *Private Eye*
dubbed it the *Grauniad*), and went on to win multiple prestigious
journalism awards, including the British Press Awards National Newspaper
of the Year in 1997 and 2006.<a href="case_id_70_id_626.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
One of its best-known scoops was a
series of investigations into Tory MPs Jonathan Aitken and Neil
Hamilton, which led to the 1997 downfall of the Conservative government.

The *Guardian* also had a substantial online presence with, by 2010, the
largest Web readership of any English-language newspaper after the *New
York Times*. The editors subscribed to a “free content” philosophy, and
declined to charge online readers. The website, launched in 1999, won
the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Webby award (given by the International Academy
of Digital Arts and Sciences) for best newspaper on the Internet. It
also swept the hustings as Best Electronic Daily Newspaper for six years
running from the British Newspaper Awards.

The *Guardian* ’s editor in 2010 was Alan Rusbridger, 57, who first
joined the paper in 1979. He left the paper for a period in the
mid-1980s, but returned in 1987 and helped to launch a new section,
*Guardian Weekend*. After a stint as deputy editor, 
<a href="case_id_70_id_174_c_bio.html">Rusbridger</a> 
was named editor in 1995; he helped foster the explosive growth of the
paper’s website.
<a href="case_id_70_id_626.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
It was that prominence online which first
attracted the attention, and the admiration, of a first-rate Internet
hacker, Julian Assange.
