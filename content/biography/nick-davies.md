**Nick Davies** had worked for the *Guardian* since 1979. Besides his 
freelance journalism, he wrote a book called *Flat Earth News*, about what 
he dubbed &ldquo;churnalism&rdquo;&mdash;the tendency of news organizations to publish 
stories that are false, distorted or propaganda. In 2009, he broke a story for the 
*Guardian* that the *News of the World* had tapped private phones 
to get material for articles.
