<strong>Nick Davies </strong>had worked for the <em>Guardian</em> since 1979. Besides his freelance journalism, he wrote a book called <em>Flat Earth News</em>, about what he dubbed &ldquo;churnalism&rdquo;&mdash;the tendency of news organizations to publish stories that are false, distorted or propaganda. In 2009, he broke a story for the <em>Guardian</em> that the <em>News of the World</em> had tapped private phones to get material for articles.</p>
