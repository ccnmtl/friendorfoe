            <p><strong>Abstract </strong></p>
            <p><em>CSJ-11-0041.0 </em>This case is about the celebrated collaboration between WikiLeaks, 
            the secure website for whistleblowers, and the mainstream media&mdash; focusing on the British 
            <em>Guardian</em> newspaper. It raises for discussion whether the <em>Guardian</em> 
            and its international media partners were correct to collaborate with WikiLeaks and to 
            publish US secret government documents. The case traces the history of the <em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s 
            relationship with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through the summer and fall 2010 publication of 
            confidential documents from the Afghan and Iraq battlefields, up through the eve of publishing a 
            trove of classified diplomatic cables in November 2010. It also examines the relationship and 
            logistics of coordinating five news organizations pledged to secrecy as they prepare to publish 
            the cables simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>Use this case to discuss government/media relations&mdash;in this instance, is 
            the US government a partner or an adversary? When is national security a reason not 
            to publish? Students should also consider what constitutes journalism and who is a 
            journalist. What is Assange? What rules should govern the <em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s 
            relationship with WikiLeaks?Also talk about international media collaboration. 
            What principles are involved? Finally, students will gain insight into the challenges 
            of data-driven reporting, and an appreciation of what is required in the Internet age 
            to process large amounts of data and make it publicly available.
            </p>
            <p>This case can be used in a class on government-media relations; 
            managing sources; data journalism; editorial decisionmaking; or international reporting.
